# **Heart Failure Prediction using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine**

---

## ðŸ“± **About the Project**

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, with heart failure being one of the most common outcomes. The dataset used in this project contains **13 clinical features** such as age, anemia, diabetes, high blood pressure, ejection fraction, and more, to predict the mortality risk of patients (**DEATH_EVENT**).  

This project aims to:  
1. Implement **Naive Bayes** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifiers on a heart failure dataset.  
2. Compare the performance of both models in classifying high-risk patients. 
3. Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and ROC/AUC curve.

## ðŸ“ˆ **Model Results**

**1. Naive Bayes**  
- Accuracy: **76%**  
- Offers simplicity, efficiency, and robust performance on medical datasets.

**2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- Accuracy: **73%**  
- Achieves competitive accuracy with strong generalization, especially when kernel functions are applied.   

**Evaluation Highlights**:    
- Machine learning can effectively support **early detection of heart failure risk**, enabling timely interventions.  
- Both Naive Bayes and SVM show reliable results, making them promising tools for **healthcare decision support systems**.  
- This study demonstrates how combining clinical expertise with AI can contribute to **better patient outcomes**.  

**Conclusion**:  
This project emphasizes the role of machine learning in healthcare analytics. 
By applying Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine to heart failure data, we show how AI models can help **predict patient survival** and support medical practitioners in making informed decisions.  
Further improvements are needed, such as data balancing techniques, hyperparameter tuning, or ensemble methods.
